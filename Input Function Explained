#input()
#This is another function, but what does it do?
#Input allows a user to enter data into a program
#Via the keyboard
#Data entered by the input function is stored...
#...in a variable
#Example:

name = input("Enter name: >>> ")
print(name)
print("Hello", name)
print("so", name, "how are you?")
